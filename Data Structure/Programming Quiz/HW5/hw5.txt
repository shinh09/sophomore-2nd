Problem Description
Write a function to calculate the maximum depth (height) of a given binary tree. The depth of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. For example, if the path from the root node to a leaf node consists of 3 nodes, the depth of the binary tree is 2.

Input
TreeNode root: A TreeNode object representing the root node of the binary tree. If the tree is empty, root will be null.

Output                               
Returns an integer representing the maximum depth of the given binary tree. If a tree is empty, it returns -1.

Constraints
The number of nodes is between 0 and 10,000.

Node values are integers between -100 and 100.
