Problem Description
You are given an array of integers that is intended to represent either a max-heap or a min-heap. The array uses a 1-based indexing system, meaning the first element (index 0) of the array is not used for heap elements but contains a flag indicating the type of heap:

   1 indicates that the array should be a max-heap.

   -1 indicates that the array should be a min-heap.

Your task is to determine if this array represents a valid heap based on the flag at index 0. In a heap, for every index i (starting from 1), the following conditions must hold:

   For a max-heap, the value of the node at index i must be greater than or equal to the values of its children.

   For a min-heap, the value of the node at index i must be less than or equal to the values of its children.

The left child of the node at index i is located at index 2*i, and the right child of the node at index i is located at index 2*i + 1.

Input
An array of integers nums where:

   nums[0] is 1 or -1, indicating whether the array should be a max-heap or a min-heap.

   The rest of the array (from index 1 onwards) contains the elements of the heap.

Output                        
Return true if the array represents a valid heap according to the flag, otherwise return false.

Constraints
The array can have a length between 2 and 100,001 (inclusive of the extra flag at index 0).

Each element in the array (from index 1 onwards) is an integer between -10^6 and 10^6.
